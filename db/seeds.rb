  name: "David Andersen",

  level: 4,
  background: "Fearless",
  description: "At 22, David led his first campaign against a band of Infernal cultists who had infiltrated Rawa City's lower districts, seeking to tear open a rift to the Abyss. It was there that he learned Infernal, a language he would come to despise yet master, using it to outmaneuver his enemies. The battle was brutal, and though victorious, David was left with a deep scar across his chest, a constant reminder of the city's vulnerability.
                His heroics earned him the title of Warden of Rawa City, a position once held by his father. But unlike his predecessors, David did not simply sit behind the city's wallsâ€”he patrolled the borders, fought alongside his soldiers, and personally ensured that Rawa remained standing.
                David is a calculated warrior, confident yet pragmatic. He is respected by his people, not for his lineage, but for his actions on the battlefield. He values loyalty above all else, which is why he has a close bond with his partner, Karisa Dunefall, a fierce warrior who stands as his second-in-command.
                At 25, David met Karisa Dunefall, a tiefling scholar from Cois Oasis. Karisa, an outcast from her people, had forged her own path as a hostage negotiator for the palace. When Rawa came under siege by a coalition of raiders and dark mages, she was sent by Cois Oasis as a symbol of their strong alliance.
                David led the patrol unit alongside Karisa in the city's streets, fighting invaders and driving them out of the city. By the battle's end, they had saved each other's lives more times than either could count. It was an unspoken bond, forged in fire and blood.
                Despite his hardened exterior, David has a deep compassion for his people. He will always put their lives before his own, even if it means making sacrifices that weigh heavily on his soul.
                Of all his weapons and abilities, Kai remains David's greatest asset. The golden-furred familiar has been with him since childhood, acting as both a guardian and a trusted companion. Their bond is unbreakable, and in battle, Kai serves as both a healer and a protector, ensuring David fights at his full potential.
